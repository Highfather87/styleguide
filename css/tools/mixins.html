      <p>Sass mixins are like <strong>functions</strong>. They can have <strong>parameters</strong> but that's optional.</p>
      <p>You <em>define</em> a mixin with the <strong>equal</strong> sign <code>=mixin(parameter)</code>.</p>
      <p>You <em>call</em> a mixin with the <strong>plus</strong> sign <code>+mixin(value)</code>.</p>
      <p>The result is basically <strong>inserted</strong> wherever you call the mixin, and as many times as you call it. So if you call the mixin 5 times throughout your CSS, the same code will be repeated 5 times.<br>Although it's not very <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>, it's straightforward and prevents some surprises.</p>
      <p><a href="http://bourbon.io/docs/">Bourbon</a> provides lots of mixins already. This <code>mixins.sass</code> file provides additional ones.</p>
